But the httpclient.py example is derived from the python documentation
examples thus some of the code is Copyright Â© 2001-2013 Python

compatible) http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html

Similarily, example code from https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html 
was used to parse responses, and examples from 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html were used to encode 
strings. In addition, code from Lab 2 for this class was referenced for 
socket handling.

httpclient.py was also made with extensive use of documentation from 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP as a reference for 
formatting and parsing data.
